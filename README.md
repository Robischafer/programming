# Sylabus

# Objectifs
This is a fast-paced introductory course to the Python and C++ programming languages. Moreover, it will cover topics from parallel computing, high-performance computing, and cloud computing.


The course is intended for those with a relatively little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn specific constructs and concepts.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

a) Understand and use the basic programming constructs of Python and C++.
b) Manipulate various data types, such as arrays, strings, and pointers).
c) Isolate and fix common errors in Python/C++ programs.
d) Use memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures.
e) Apply object-oriented approaches to software problems in Python and C++.
f) Write small-scale Python C++ programs using the above skills.
g) Understand algorithmic complexity.
i) Understand how to accelerate software by means of parallel computation.
j) Deploy software on cloud infrastructure.

In summary, the goal of this course is to provide students with the skills and confidence in computational problem-solving.

Pré-requis
No strict pre-requirement is necessary apart from a personal interest in computing and the basic knowledge of mathematics delivered in the bachelor programme. Students are encouraged to have a strong interest in computationally solve complex problems.

This FAST-PACED course will consist of both lectures, software tutorials, and exercises. For the tutorials and exercises, you will need to bring a laptop computer to each class. If you do not have a laptop computer, you can still follow the class but please contact the professor to help you find a solution for effective participation in the practical hands-on exercises.


Evaluation
1ère tentative
Examen:
Sans examen (cf. modalités)  
Evaluation:
There will be two graded home-take exams (each counting for 25% of the final grade, totaling in 50% of the final grade) and a term paper of 10 pages length thatneeds to be presented in class (the term paper and the presentation together account for the remaining 50% of the grade).


We will award the grades based on whether problem set grades are generally on par with the class average and whether the final project and presentation demonstrate an understanding of the material. There will be no written exams.

Rattrapage
Examen:
Sans examen (cf. modalités)  
Evaluation:
Following HEC guidelines, we allow a second attempt to any or all of the partial grades with a result below 4.0 if and only if your overall grade is below 4.0. This means that, for example, if your project received a grade of 4.0 and both your take-home exams a grade of 3.5, you have the choice to redo one or both take-home exams to try to move the average above the minimum grade.
If you received a grade below 4.0 for your project and choose to redo it, you will also have to present said project during the summer.
You will be granted one week to complete and hand-in the retake of the take-home exams (non-cumulative, if you redo to take-home exams, you still have one week). Two weeks will be given to redo the project and present the results from a date agreed upon onward.


As with the regular evaluation, we will award the grades based on whether the home-take exam grades are generally on par with the class average and whether the final project demonstrates an understanding of the material.
